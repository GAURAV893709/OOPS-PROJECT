# OOPS-PROJECT
Project Description:

In this project, we design a digital clock simulation using the C++ programming language.
The program takes the initial time (hours, minutes, and seconds) from the user and then continuously updates the time every second.

The project uses loops to repeatedly display the time, and basic logic to handle the transition of seconds, minutes, and hours â€” just like a real clock.

The main features of this project are:

Display time in a formatted (hh:mm:ss) style.

Automatic increment of time every second.

Loop-based simulation that runs continuously.

Works in any C++ compiler.

Tools Used:

Programming Language: C++

Concepts Used: Loops, Conditional statements, Header files, Delays using chrono library

Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (like Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or online compiler)
